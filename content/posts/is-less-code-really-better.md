Is less lines of code really better?

Programmers are very religious people. They can hold to some axiomatic belief as if it were a matter of divine revelation. Then they go on and evangelize on them, proclaiming their gospel everywere they go, gaining adepts for their cause.

If you ever meet a programmer like that, don't run away! Listen to them carefully (what they say is usually true in some aspect) but then you go home and do your homework: analyze, see every possible scenario, think deeper.

Personally, one of the statements that are spread like plague everywhere is what I call the "less lines of code is better" gospel. It is usually presented by using a reductionist example, like two ways of deleting elements from an array, one written significantly shorter than the other.

Let me give you the TLDR for this one: less lines of code is not *always* better. 

Please note my emphasised "always". 

We are programmers: our life work is about precision. When we write or say something, we should be as precise as when we are writing a parsing algorithm. If a programmer comes to me saying "less lines of code is better" I assume they mean that as an absolute statement since there are no adverbs in sigth.
