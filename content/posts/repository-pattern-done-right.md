title: Repository Pattern Done Right
subtitle: Because there are too many poor implementations

The repository pattern is one of the most well established patterns in Domain Driven Design. It's origins can be traced as early as Object Oriented Programing was born.

Of course, like it happens with almost every pattern or tool, you can really use it terribly the first time (or even the second, or the third one). The only way to improve upon that is good literature and seeing other, more appropriate, uses of the pattern/tool. Refining your use of tools and patterns this way is, with almost all certainty, the only way to grow as a developer. Years of experience don't count much if you have been doing the same thing, the same way, over and over again.

This is why I implement and use repositories very differently now than the first time I started. This is probably because of the experience (both good and bad) that I've accumulated over the years. I've also read quite a lot on the topic, and certain I'm not the only one that has experienced issues implementing repositories in my applications.
