Now, we are slowly realizing that we should have never, ever, abandoned the monolith. Our multiple failures at microservices probably speak of two things, (1) we probably lack the workforce and proper Ops team to carry this effort onward and (2) we probably could have solved our problem without them anyway. Note that I&amp;rsquo;m saying that microservices are fine.</description></item></channel></rss>
