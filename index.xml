That&amp;rsquo;s nice sometimes because it means staying at home with loads of time to do one of my favorite things: getting myself into learning and coding (I also did some cleaning, cooking and DIYing too!).
I was surfing YouTube for good coding talks and one caught my attention. It was Jack Diederich&amp;rsquo;s PyCon 2012 talk entitled &amp;ldquo;Stop Writing Classes&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>The case for Object Mapping</title><link>https://mnavarro.dev/posts/the-case-for-object-mapping/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Apr 2020 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mnavarro.dev/posts/the-case-for-object-mapping/</guid><description>Introduction: A Tale of Simplicity VS Complexity NOTE: Every time the word array is used in this article I&amp;rsquo;m referring to the PHP definition of this term. You can also consider that term equivalent, for the purposes of this article only, to use instances of stdClass or instances of classes that contain dynamic public properties, like Active Record Models. This is because the deficiencies pointed with arrays apply to those constructs as well.</description></item><item><title>Getting Continuous Integration right</title><link>https://mnavarro.dev/posts/the-continuous-on-integration/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2020 16:30:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://mnavarro.dev/posts/the-continuous-on-integration/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve participated in a good number of projects in my short life as a developer. Luckily, when I started in this business, git was a thing already and was one of the first tools I learned to use. I often wonder how anyone was able to build software in the past without it.
The best value that git brought to software development was not so much related to keeping a versioning history of a codebase (which is already pretty big value!</description></item><item><title>Going back to the Monolith well</title><link>https://mnavarro.dev/posts/back-to-the-monolith/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2020 23:30:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://mnavarro.dev/posts/back-to-the-monolith/</guid><description>We were extremely warned about the dangers of microservices, but we implement them anyway. Now, we are slowly realizing that we should have never, ever, abandoned the monolith. Our multiple failures at microservices probably speak of two things, (1) we probably lack the workforce and proper Ops team to carry this effort onward and (2) we probably could have solved our problem without them anyway. Note that I&amp;rsquo;m saying that microservices are fine.</description></item><item><title>Repository Pattern Done Right</title><link>https://mnavarro.dev/posts/repository-pattern-done-right/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2020 20:00:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://mnavarro.dev/posts/repository-pattern-done-right/</guid><description>The repository pattern is one of the most well established patterns in Domain Driven Design. It&amp;rsquo;s origins can be traced as early as when Object Oriented Programing was born.
Of course, like it happens with almost every pattern or tool, you can really use it terribly the first time (or even the second, or the third one). The only way to improve upon that is good literature and seeing other, more appropriate, uses of the pattern/tool.</description></item><item><title>Media</title><link>https://mnavarro.dev/media/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2020 16:50:09 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://mnavarro.dev/media/</guid><description>Talks and Workshops Sometimes, nice people take a video when I talk about cool things.

Event Sourcing Applied - DevFest, Santiago CL, Oct-2019 Container Theory and Docker - Option SpA, Santiago CL, Dec-2019 PHP Bits Everyone would like to be a famous YouTuber, right? Well, this is my poorly-executed attempt to become one, where I teach about coding and best practices, mostly in PHP.</description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>https://mnavarro.dev/about/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2020 12:19:53 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://mnavarro.dev/about/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m Matías, a PHP Jedi Master based in the UK.

It is trivial to unit test classes depending in filesystem abstractions like Flysystem or Gaufrette: just a simple mock of the interface and we are done.
However, from time to time I was kinda annoyed with some limitations of the abstractions, specially in regards to stream handling.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Reports in PHP</title><link>https://mnavarro.dev/posts/php-efficient-reporting/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2019 11:18:48 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://mnavarro.dev/posts/php-efficient-reporting/</guid><description>&lt;p>When it comes to reporting, I have a predefined set of rules that I follow sacredly and that will ensure that my report writing experience will be nice and problem-free.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Entendiendo Versionamiento Semántico</title><link>https://mnavarro.dev/posts/semantic-versioning/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Oct 2019 11:18:48 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://mnavarro.dev/posts/semantic-versioning/</guid><description>Hace poco estaba hablando con un colega y recomendándole una librería para ayudarle en un problema que estaba tratando de resolver. Mientras le hablaba de cómo funcionaba la librería, abrió el repositorio Github de la misma y vio el número de version (1.1.5) y me dijo “No es muy buena, está solo en versión 1”.
Lo miré con cara de confundido e inmediatamente me di cuenta que su entendimiento de versionamiento semántico era algo así como “Las buenas librerías son las que tienen un número de version alto”.</description></item></channel></rss>
