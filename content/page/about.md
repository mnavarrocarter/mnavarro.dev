I'm Mat√≠as, a PHP Jedi Master based in the UK. I'm an skilled Backend Web Developer but I can also do frontend. I also develop in Node JS, and I'm familiar with Python, Go and Vala.

I have experience in all sort of projects, of different sizes and of wide spectrum of domains: medical, multimedia, air traveling and e-commerce. My style of development revolves around the ideas of Domain Driven Design. This means that when I develop software, I try to understand and breathe the business, in order to effectively model it into code. I mostly do web development, specially (truly) REST apis; but I also develop cli apps and tiny desktop apps for Linux.

I'm a open source maintainer of some libraries. One of my dearest projects is [Espresso], a next-generation HTTP layer for PHP, pretty much inspired on Express JS. I'm also developing [Historian], an Event Sourcing library for PHP.

## What services do you provide?

Most of my time is dedicated now to my current employer. However, I have spare time to do some consulting, teaching or speaking.

In the consulting area I can provide assistance from helping you to pick a team of skilled developers for your project, analyze the technical debt of your application, provide guidelines on how to implement a feature or start a project, and about pretty much any other thing you need.

I can also teach on various topics related to software development: CI/CD, Docker, Linux, Kubernetes, PHP, Git, HTTP protocol, REST, OOP, Design Patterns, Node. Get in touch with me if you want me to meet your team!

Lastly, I love to attend to and speak at conferences. If you want me to do a little talk or workshop in your conference, don't hesitate to ask!
