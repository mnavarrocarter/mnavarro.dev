I think it sets a bad precedent for when developers need to come up with their own environment variables in their applications.
I have seen environment variables in an application that should have never been environment variables. And other things that should have been but have not made it to the list.
So, I thought I&amp;rsquo;ll write this piece to rant a bit about this.</description></item></channel></rss>
