I want to tell Jonny's story. Jonny is a programmer like you and me. As every programmer, he has a story with OOP. Jonny started in OOP like all of us: with no clue whatsoever of what he was doing. But along the way, Jonny developed the necessary skills and understanding to help him master the art of Object Oriented Programming. I think Jonny's story can teach us some valuable things.

> Disclaimer: Jonny is a totally fictitious character based on my own growing and experience. If you see yourself in Jonny and somehow that offends you, please bear in mind Jonny is just an made up example of my experience that has nothing to do with you.

## Jonny learns the basics

Jonny's first contact with OOP was, like in most people's experience, mostly theoretical and not so practical. He understood that we can create these things called classes and put some variables and functions inside them (he also knew they are called properties and methods). He knows that inheritance is one of the key features of OOP, allowing him to extend general objects into more particular ones, like the classic `Cat extends Mammal & Mammal extends Animal` example. He also knows that some data (properties) and behavior (methods) can be hidden by from other classes by using keywords like `protected` or `private`, something that allows encapsulation (an OOP pillar). He knows about abstract classes and interfaces, which in turn enable polymorphism, which is another OOP pillar.

But Jonny still does not know how to use these constructs and features of OOP for his own benefit. He sorts of understands them, and can also explain them at some degree, but for some reason he has trouble telling others about why they are useful and important. His only interaction with classes is by using third party HTTP frameworks or libraries. He adds methods to controllers, or calls methods in other classes, but he does not understand how these work under the hood and how everything is wired up together. 

## Jonny learns how to read other's people code

## Jonny learns how to abstract a problem away

## Jonny learns how to break down a problem in different parts

## Jonny learns how to wire things together

## Jonny learns how to apply inheritance judiciously
- Inheritance is when you start general and want to move to specific
- Composition is when you want to add behavior or simplify an api

## Jonny learns how to deal with Exceptions

- Coding to an interface
- Adapters

## Jonny learns strategic patterns to solve common problems
- Decorator
- Chain

## Jonny learns how to design objects rather than just make classes
- Proper encapsulation
- Rich methods
- Immutability
