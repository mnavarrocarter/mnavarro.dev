The error was due to an exception that could not be caught, because it was not an exception class. The culprit, the 1.1.1 version of psr/container, had removed extends Throwable from the Psr/Container/ContainerExceptionInterface. Here is the related issue.
Now, this was all done to a language support issue, which is understandable. But this exposed a somewhat related issue.</description></item><item><title>Preventing tenant pollution in multitenant applications</title><link>https://mnavarro.dev/posts/tenant-pollution/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://mnavarro.dev/posts/tenant-pollution/</guid><description>Last year I built a multitenant system for my employer Spatialest. It was my first time doing a multitenant system, so I researched a lot before doing it. I studied carefully the experience of platforms like Shopify, as their multi tenant requirements were similar to ours. But even after some careful study, I made some mistakes.
One of those mistakes is what I&amp;rsquo;ve come to call tenant pollution. This means that many services or routines need the tenant as an argument in order to do something.</description></item><item><title>Namespaced Taxonomy Syndrome</title><link>https://mnavarro.dev/posts/namespaced-taxonomy-sindrome/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jul 2020 20:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://mnavarro.dev/posts/namespaced-taxonomy-sindrome/</guid><description>The Discovery of a Syndrome The past week I had some really nice holidays, but my wife still had to work. That&amp;rsquo;s nice sometimes because it means staying at home with loads of time to do one of my favorite things: getting myself into learning and coding (I also did some cleaning, cooking and DIYing too!).
I was surfing YouTube for good coding talks and one caught my attention. It was Jack Diederich&amp;rsquo;s PyCon 2012 talk entitled &amp;ldquo;Stop Writing Classes&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>The case for Object Mapping</title><link>https://mnavarro.dev/posts/the-case-for-object-mapping/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Apr 2020 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mnavarro.dev/posts/the-case-for-object-mapping/</guid><description>Introduction: A Tale of Simplicity VS Complexity NOTE: Every time the word array is used in this article I&amp;rsquo;m referring to the PHP definition of this term. You can also consider that term equivalent, for the purposes of this article only, to use instances of stdClass or instances of classes that contain dynamic public properties, like Active Record Models. This is because the deficiencies pointed with arrays apply to those constructs as well.</description></item><item><title>Going back to the Monolith well</title><link>https://mnavarro.dev/posts/back-to-the-monolith/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2020 23:30:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://mnavarro.dev/posts/back-to-the-monolith/</guid><description>We were extremely warned about the dangers of microservices, but we implement them anyway. Now, we are slowly realizing that we should have never, ever, abandoned the monolith. Our multiple failures at microservices probably speak of two things, (1) we probably lack the workforce and proper Ops team to carry this effort onward and (2) we probably could have solved our problem without them anyway. Note that I&amp;rsquo;m saying that microservices are fine.</description></item><item><title>Repository Pattern Done Right</title><link>https://mnavarro.dev/posts/repository-pattern-done-right/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2020 20:00:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://mnavarro.dev/posts/repository-pattern-done-right/</guid><description>The repository pattern is one of the most well established patterns in Domain Driven Design. It&amp;rsquo;s origins can be traced as early as when Object Oriented Programing was born.
Of course, like it happens with almost every pattern or tool, you can really use it terribly the first time (or even the second, or the third one). The only way to improve upon that is good literature and seeing other, more appropriate, uses of the pattern/tool.</description></item><item><title>Entendiendo Versionamiento Semántico</title><link>https://mnavarro.dev/posts/semantic-versioning/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Oct 2019 11:18:48 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://mnavarro.dev/posts/semantic-versioning/</guid><description>Hace poco estaba hablando con un colega y recomendándole una librería para ayudarle en un problema que estaba tratando de resolver. Mientras le hablaba de cómo funcionaba la librería, abrió el repositorio Github de la misma y vio el número de version (1.1.5) y me dijo “No es muy buena, está solo en versión 1”.
Lo miré con cara de confundido e inmediatamente me di cuenta que su entendimiento de versionamiento semántico era algo así como “Las buenas librerías son las que tienen un número de version alto”.</description></item></channel></rss>
