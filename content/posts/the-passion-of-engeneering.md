I think the intelectual challenge of engineering is one of the most rewarding. Having multiple ways of solving one problem, we are inevitably launched into the exquisite quest of finding the most appropiate solution to any challenge. It is the quest itself, not solving the problem, what makes it so rewarding. This neverending quest for knowledge is what got me so interested into programming in the first place. It never gets old: just when you think you are getting something rigth, you realize that there is a novel, better way of doing things. This goes well with us, restless spirits.

But this beautiful and exciting reality is also our doom.
