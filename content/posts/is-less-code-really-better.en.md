Programmers are very religious people. They can hold to some axiomatic belief as if it were a matter of divine revelation. Then they go on and evangelize on them, proclaiming their gospel everywere they go, gaining adepts for their cause.

If you ever meet a programmer like that, don't run away! Listen to them carefully (what they say is usually true in some aspect) but then you go home and do your homework: analyze, see every possible scenario, think deeper.

Personally, one of the statements that are spread like plague everywhere is what I call the "less lines of code is better" gospel. It is usually presented by using a reductionist example, like two ways of deleting elements from an array, one written significantly shorter than the other.

Let me give you the TLDR for this one: less lines of code is not *always* better. 

Please note my emphasised "always". 

We are programmers: our life work is about precision. When we write or say something, we should be as precise as when we are writing a parsing algorithm. If a programmer comes to me saying "less lines of code is better" I assume they mean that as an absolute statement since there are no adverbs in sigth. We shold make our points across better than that.

Anyways, this is not an argument about gramar. What I've done is that I have read several articles of proponents of this philosophy and analyzed their reasons and assumptions for holding that particular view.
