1. "I need to know!": the observer pattern

Explain the observer pattern and benefits when applied to data.

2. A Simple Api: Subscribe and Mutate.

Design a good api that implements this pattern.

3. Application state is side-effecty (fetched, cached, mutated)

Keep side effects under control with `useEffect`

4. Compose, don't glue.

Don't stick things together, make them work together! Separate concerns.

Local storage and history are two good examples.
