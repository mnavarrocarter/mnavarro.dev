Layers of abstraction, tooling, patterns, tradeoffs, dependencies, people, are some of the reasons behind hard things in Software development. But there is also a big source of complexity: ourselves and our poor choices.
Incidental complexity is the technical term for this kind of complexity. It is defined as anything in software that is hard but really does not need to be.

The Philosophical Answer If you think about it, it is not an easy question to answer. Maybe you have already some strong opinions formed about it. But, in my experience, answers to this question differ greatly among developers, even between seasoned ones.
I believe those differences are due to some preconceived ideas or different definitions about what testing is.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/http-sdk-testing-in-go/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://blog.mnavarro.dev/posts/environment-variables-done-right/>Environment Variables Done Right</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2021-07-02</span></div><span class=post-tags>#<a href=https://blog.mnavarro.dev/tags/php/>PHP</a>&nbsp;

One of those mistakes is what I&rsquo;ve come to call tenant pollution.
