It is usually presented by using a reductionist example, like two ways of deleting elements from an array, one written significantly shorter than the other.</p><p>Let me give you the TLDR for this one: less lines of code is not <em>always</em> better.</p><p>Please note my emphasised &ldquo;always&rdquo;.</p><p>We are programmers: our life work is about precision. When we write or say something, we should be as precise as when we are writing a parsing algorithm. If a programmer comes to me saying &ldquo;less lines of code is better&rdquo; I assume they mean that as an absolute statement since there are no adverbs in sigth.</p></div><div class=post-nav><div class=post-nav-next><a href=https://mnavarro.dev/posts/semantic-versioning/>Entendiendo Versionamiento Semántico</a></div></div></article><div class=comments><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=application/javascript>var disqus_config=function(){};(function(){if(["localhost","127.0.0.1"].indexOf(window.location.hostname)!=-1){document.getElementById('disqus_thread').innerHTML='Disqus comments not available by default when the website is previewed locally.';return;}
