title: Demistifying ORMs
draft: true

Orm critiques can be really vocal about their hate on ORMs, [as Martin Fowler already has pointed out][1]. But as he also said, a lot of the ORM hate is unwarranted to say the least. 

Summarizing, I've heard three main criticisms against ORMs. I would like to answer to those building on Matin Fowler's post. 

## 1. ORMs are a leaky abstraction, therefore you should avoid them


## 2. ORMs are complex. Using raw queries is simpler and more efficient.


## 3. ORMs create impedance mismatch, so don't use them
