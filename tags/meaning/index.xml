I did this after a year and three months at Spatialest, in which I had the privilege of meeting kind and hardworking people that welcomed this very weird and unknown Chilean person into their lives and into their company. It was also a time of growth: I could develop some mentoring skills; I was able to become pretty good at React, and I was able to learn a bit more about multi-tenant solutions and implement my first multi-tenant platform.</description></item></channel></rss>
