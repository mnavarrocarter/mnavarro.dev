You can also consider that term equivalent, for the purposes of this article only, to use instances of stdClass or instances of classes that contain dynamic public properties, like Active Record Models. This is because the deficiencies pointed with arrays apply to those constructs as well.</description></item><item><title>Going back to the Monolith well</title><link>https://mnavarro.dev/posts/back-to-the-monolith/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2020 23:30:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://mnavarro.dev/posts/back-to-the-monolith/</guid><description>We were extremely warned about the dangers of microservices, but we implement them anyway. Now, we are slowly realizing that we should have never, ever, abandoned the monolith. Our multiple failures at microservices probably speak of two things, (1) we probably lack the workforce and proper Ops team to carry this effort onward and (2) we probably could have solved our problem without them anyway. Note that I&amp;rsquo;m saying that microservices are fine.</description></item></channel></rss>
