I think the first thing that needs to be said is that this is not general problem solving. True, some of the methods here will make sense in a more general problem solving context, and you can judge for yourself which one of those makes sense to you and your field. My main concern here though are problems that can be solved by programming. After all, I'm a programmer and my job is to solve problems writing code in a particular programing language.

The kind of problems programmers have to solve varies as well. Some problems are really technical, like how to do load balancing for an application in Nginx. Those problems, no matter how difficult they may be, are also not my main concern here. Usually you can solve those by reading some documentation about the topic. It's a matter of knowledge. 

Other problems are more algorithmically in nature: how to sort efficiently, or how find the shortest path in an directed graph, and so on. Though very useful and interesting, these are not my main concern either. There is abundant literature and coding challenges out there for you to master those. These are a matter of practice.

My main concern here is how to solve a problems that require design, especially clever design. If you have read any of the Domain Driven Design books by Eric Evans, or Patters of Enterprise Application Architecture by Martin Fowler, you know what problems I'm talking about.
