It was my first time doing a multitenant system, so I researched a lot before doing it. I studied carefully the experience of platforms like Shopify, as their multi tenant requirements were similar to ours. But even after some careful study, I made some mistakes.
One of those mistakes is what I&amp;rsquo;ve come to call tenant pollution. This means that many services or routines need the tenant as an argument in order to do something.</description></item></channel></rss>
